# This csv file was downloaded from the SRA

sradf <- read.csv(file.path(path, "data/analysis-individual/AGP/SraRunTable.csv"))

# This tsv file was downloaded from the figshare
# link shared by the paper from McDonald et al., 2018
paperdf <- read_tsv(file.path(path, "data/analysis-individual/AGP/correctedt2.tsv"))

# Compare two tables
dim(sradf) # 33,610 samples
dim(paperdf) # 17,854 samples

# The paper was published in 2018, so it is possible that more samples have been added on the SRA since
table(str_sub(paperdf$collection_date, start=-4)) # latest sample from paper metadata table is 2017
table(str_sub(sradf$ENA.FIRST.PUBLIC..run., end=4)) # latest sample from SRA metadata is 2021

# => We will extract sample names from SRA metadata
